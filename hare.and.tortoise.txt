  The Hare and the Tortoise 


  A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started
together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on
with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. 
The Hare, speeding up with every step, inevitably came up to 
the tortoise and moved swiftly around him, a cool breeze being felt
by the Tortoise as the Hare did so. The Hare came upon the 
finishing line and passed it.


    Slow but steady wins the race.
